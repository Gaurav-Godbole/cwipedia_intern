Assignment for Flutter Developers
The goal of the assignment is to:
-> Show the capability of adjusting to the technical environment
-> Demonstrate the will to develop and test high-quality features/functionalities
-> Test the candidate's knowledge of network calls, local databases, and state management.
-> Test the candidate on a clean-coding field
-> Test the candidate on the project scaling field
Assignment Task:
Create a Flutter project demonstrating server-client communication, navigation flow, and a certain form of State Management.
Install the Flutter environment on your computer, along with a visual code editor (preferably VS Code), and run the template application.
The app contains 2 sections of tasks as follows:
Deadline to submit: 2nd FEB
Home: 
In this section/screen, you will need to demonstrate your skills related to network calls and local storage.
Implement setup for network calls and local storage. You are free to use packages of your choice for both. Example: Https, Dio, Chopper, and Hive for local DB.
2. Fetch the data from open APIs for testing such as :
https://any-api.com/
Homepage
 You are free to use any open source API of your choice.
3. Save the response to the local storage of your choice and update the ui according to using state management.
4. On the page, a search bar is present at the top. It should be functional by filtering your locally saved data.
All Tasks and Complete Tasks
This section/screen you will need to demonstrate your skills related to state management. Please use a state management lib of your choice
It's a simple to-do app where you will need to fetch data from firebase firestore and update the ui according to their completed status.
The user should be able to complete, read, update and delete the tasks i.e CRUD operations.
The data should be updated in firebase firestore and reflected in the ui as soon as one of the operations is done. Try to notify the user by showing a message based on their operations.
The ui should be updated accordingly based on the status-completed for tasks. This state should update the UI. Therefore you should be able to complete a task on the ‘Tasks’ page and it appears on the ‘Completed Tasks’ page
Test Cases:
Try to demonstrate at least one for each of the following:
Unit Test
Widget Test
Add any additional functionality/cleanup you think would improve the app (bonus points)
After Completion:
Upload the code on your github and send us a link :
Note:
Try to implement extensions where you think it can be done.
Build an attractive UI
UI Part is most important so design it as beautifully as you can
Error handling should be implemented properly.
Thank you.
